The information included in this 10-Q should be read in\nconjunction with the footnotes and management\u2019s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial statements in the 10-K.\nThe results of operations for the quarter and two quarters ended April 2, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved for\nthe entire fiscal year ending October 1, 2023 (\u201cfiscal 2023\u201d).\nThe novel coronavirus, known as the global COVID-19 pandemic, was first identified in December 2019 before spreading to markets where we have company-\noperated or licensed stores. We have since established the necessary protocols to operate safely, and in many of our markets, our businesses demonstrated\npowerful momentum beyond recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. During the quarter ended April 2, 2023, our China market began recovering from\npandemic-related business interruptions in previous quarters that had suppressed customer mobility. We continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its\neffect on our business and results of operations; however, we cannot predict the duration, scope or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or its future impact on\nour business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRestructuring\nIn fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience (the \u201cReinvention Plan\u201d).\nWe believe the company-operated market investments in partner wages and trainings have increased retention and productivity while the acceleration of\npurpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers. As a result of the\nrestructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded an immaterial charge on our consolidated statements of earnings during the quarter\nand two quarters ended April 2, 2023. Future restructuring and impairment costs attributable to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material.\nAs of April 2, 2023 and October 2, 2022, there were no material restructuring-related accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued guidance related to reference rate reform. The\npronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the\nfinancial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and other interbank offered rates to\nalternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31,\n2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nNote 2: Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance\nFiscal 2023\nOn January 13, 2023, we sold the assets, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, to Nestl for $110.0\nmillion. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $91.3 million, which was included in gain from sale of assets on our consolidated statements of earnings.\nResults from Seattle's Best Coffee operations prior to the sale are reported in our Channel Development operating segment.\n10\nTable of Contents\nFiscal 2022\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business to Bolthouse Farms. This transaction did not have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements.\nNote 3: Derivative Financial Instruments\nInterest Rates\nFrom time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into\ninterest rate swap agreements and treasury locks, which are synthetic forward sales of U.S. Treasury securities settled in cash based upon the difference\nbetween an agreed-upon treasury rate and the prevailing treasury rate at settlement. These agreements are cash settled at the time of the pricing of the related\ndebt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (\u201cAOCI\u201d) and is subsequently reclassified to interest\nexpense over the life of the related debt.\nTo hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges",

Refer to Note 8, Debt, for additional information on our long-term debt.\nForeign Currency\nTo reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated\nintercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives\nare recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue, product and distribution costs, or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged\nexposures affect net earnings.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into financial instruments, including, but not limited to, forward and swap contracts or foreign currency-denominated debt, to\nhedge the currency exposure of our net investments in certain international operations. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in\nAOCI and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated.\nForeign currency forward and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain other balance\nsheet items. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency-denominated payables and\nreceivables, and these gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net.\nCommodities\nDepending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge anticipated cash flows under our price-to-\nbe-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in Note 5, Inventories, or our longer-dated forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price\nand price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and\ndistribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.\nDepending on market conditions, we may also enter into dairy forward contracts and futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our\ndairy purchase contracts and our forecasted dairy demand. The resulting gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and\ndistribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.\nCash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are\nclassified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the underlying transactions\nare no longer probable of occurring, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated\nstatements of earnings. These derivatives may be accounted for prospectively as non-designated derivatives until maturity, re-designated to new hedging\nrelationships or terminated early. We continue to believe transactions related to our other designated cash flow hedges are probable to occur.\nTo mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, including diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures and\ncollars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net to help offset price\nfluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging and transportation costs, which are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of\nearnings.\n11\nTable of Contents\nGains and losses on derivative contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt designated as hedging instruments included in AOCI and expected to be\nreclassified into earnings within 12 months, net of tax (in millions):\nNet Gains/(Losses)\nIncluded in AOCI Net Gains/(Losses) Expected\nto be Reclassified from AOCI\ninto Earnings within 12\nMonthsOutstanding Contract/Debt\nRemaining Maturity\n(Months) Apr 2, 2023 Oct 2, 2022\nCash Flow Hedges:\nCoffee $ (89.8)$ 153.9 $ (87.7) 4\nCross-currency swaps (1.3) (1.9) \u2014 20\nDairy (3.4) (2.6) (3.4) 10\nForeign currency - other 11.7 55.3 11.7 33\nInterest rates (5.3) (5.8) 0.2 0\nNet Investment Hedges:\nCross-currency swaps 46.7 67.3 \u2014 108\nForeign currency 16.1 16.1 \u2014 0\nForeign currency debt 86.8 125",
